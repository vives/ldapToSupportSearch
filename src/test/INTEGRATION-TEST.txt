Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB LDAP connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base is required. this test suite has been configured to download this automatically. however if its fail download following project and compile using mvn clean install command to update your local repository.
   https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-integration-base

Tested Platform: 

 - Mac OSX 10.9.2
 - UBUNTU 14.04
 - WSO2 ESB 4.9.0
 
 STEPS:

1. Make sure the WSO2 ESB 4.9.0 zip file with available at "{LDAP_HOME}/repository/"

2.Follow the below mentioned steps for adding valid certificate to access LDAP server over SSL.

       	i)   To encrypt the connections, we'll need to configure a certificate authority (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-encrypt-openldap-connections-using-starttls) and use it to sign the keys for the LDAP server.
       	ii)  Go to new ESB 4.9.0 folder and place the created certificate in both "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" and "{LDAP_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" folders.
       	iii) Navigate to "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import ldap certificate in to keystore.
       		 Give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

       		 NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was created. (e.g. ca_certs.pem)
       			    CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. vive.example.com)

       	iv)  Navigate to "{LDAP_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import ldap certificate in to keystore.
       		 Give "wso2carbon" as password.

       		 NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was created, change it accordingly. (e.g. ca_certs.pem)
       			   CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. vive.example.com)

3. Integration Tests uses Embedded in-memory LDAP server in tests. So normally connector doesn't need an external LDAP server to run its tests.
    If you want to test the Connector with your LDAP server, do necessary changes to LDAP properties file at location
    "{LDAP_HOME}/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/connector/config".

	providerUrl - URL of you LDAP server
    	securityPrincipal - Root user DN
    	securityCredentials - Root user password
    	secureConnection - The boolean value for the secure connection.
    	disableSSLCertificateChecking - The boolean value to check whether certificate enable or not
    	onlyOneReference - The boolean value whether to guarantee or not only one reference
    	testUserId- The user ID
    	ldapUserBase - User Base of the LDAP server
    	testUserId - Sample test user id
    	baseDN - Base DN of the LDAP server
    	ldapPort - Port which Embedded LDAP server should be started. (Default 10389)
    	useEmbeddedLDAP - Use embedded LDAP server or outside ldap sever. If you want to use your LDAP server to test with the Connector, make this value - false

4. Navigate to "{LDAP_HOME}/" and run the following command.
      $ mvn clean install

NOTE : 
If you are using Embedded LDAP mode in Integration Testing, please make sure that ldapPort you are assigning in config file is not used by any other application in your local machine.
